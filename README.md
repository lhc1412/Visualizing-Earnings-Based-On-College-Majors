# Visualizing-Earnings-Based-On-College-Majors
In this project, We'll be working with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by American Community Survey, which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their Github repo.

Using visualizations, we can start to explore questions from the dataset like:

Do students in more popular majors make more money?
How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
Which category of majors have the most students?
Summary of results
After analysing the data, the following findings can be drawn.

Students in more popular majors do not make more money.
Students that majored in subjects that were majority female do not make more money.
No link between the number of full-time employees and median salary is found.
55 subjects are predominantly male.
69 subjects are predominantly female.
In top 10 majors with highest median earnings, 8 majors are predominantly male.
In last 10 majors with highest median earnings, all 10 majors are predominantly female.
No significant different in unemployment rate can be found between top 10 and last 10 majors.
Arts, Health, and Education are the major categories with highest number of students.
